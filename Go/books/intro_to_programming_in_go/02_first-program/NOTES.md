```
package main

import "fmt"
```

Every Go program must start with a package declaration, which come in two types:
executables and libraries.

The `import` keyword is how to include code from other packages to use with our
program.

Use the `godoc` command to get more information (ex: `godoc cmd/fmt Println`).
